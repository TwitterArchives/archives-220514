The definition we were using, or, I had assumed we were using, was "state" as in the sovereign government of an entire nation. The definition you are dragging in refers to sub-divisions of a nation.

I've already said they weren't operating under the final system of communism itself, but it was absolutely their end goal, so it's kind of dumb to say they weren't a "communist" country.

The same cannot really be said about China, who has more or less abandoned everything related to communism except the aesthetic.
