Why do you play the game by dodging the concept in itself and agreeing to the premise that any criticism of the elites is anti-semitism (synonym for 'evil badthink')  https://twitter.com/petercoffin/status/1386673028428353542  pic.twitter.com/Qm8s3QMYkR

So they reverted to the deplatforming and censorship to enforce their ideas, and are just making some meek complaints now that it's come back to slightly nip them.

It's getting to the point where I'm tilted and have to force myself to keep up drawing.   Black Mussolini is the greatest comic I've ever made, my beloved masterpiece.

Both your teams are led by the tribe and you're too philosemitc to ever look up.

And now you're changing it to be that oh maybe some interests have "SWAY". Not total and complete control of our government, no; they just have some SWAY.  So did you lie on that other tweet and now have to change position? Typical

Nobody cared about sounding "bigoted" against the Germans. Yet you opt to play footsie when talking about Jews and their hyper-nationalist apartheid state.
* [20 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420221453/https://twitter.com/orange_hat_bro/status/1384631565364387842): So, why won't you refer to them as Jews and instead opt to always use words like "Zionist" with the excuse being that you don't want to be "anti-semitic"? When, for example, the Germans wouldn't be afforded the same accomadation?
* [20 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210420221247/https://twitter.com/orange_hat_bro/status/1384631008100683781): You would have been laughed out of anywhere saying you werent ACKSHUALLY anti-German, or not referring to the upholders Nazi state as "The Germans" and instead saying "the NAZIS" only.

Say those words and maybe I'd almost believe you.  Imagine being in the 30 and saying "i'm not anti-GERMAN, i'm just anti-NAZI!" When you oppose a country, you oppose on its own merit. Not referring to it with a nebulous cover term.

You will always use the code word "zionism" so you don't have to address that Jewish nationalism had hardcore bipartisan support from every single politician.  You are pro-israel, because you don't actually recognize what it is and what empowers it.

A website that wasn't a we wuz kangz blog claims he invented a piece that was the precursor to the V-chip, which is used for remote controls. He did not invent it what he made was built upon and became it.

This is because Trump energizes our rhetoric and helps us to find likeminded people within the System.   This is the strategy Lenin pursued; participating in electoralism to find people in the system, then.. well, doing what he did. We should do the same for us. https://twitter.com/orange_hat_bro/status/1324446475124793344

If they drop Trump, and by extension any semblance of nationalist rhetoric, they can eat shit 100%. Trump at least amplifies our rhetoric and his presence helps us find like minded people in the System.
