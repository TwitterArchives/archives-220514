I thought he genuinely wanted to join us for a hike. It‚Äôs great for your physical health and your mental well-being. It‚Äôs a shame he‚Äôs chosen to interpret this negatively.   @RamblersGB , what say you?

Great way to keep fit too.  Not sure what ‚Äúadenoidal‚Äù means - presumably something nice.  Look forward to seeing you on our next walk.

Their numbers have been decimated in recent decades. We want to protect them as a native species of the land we love.   https://www.countryfile.com/news/new-report-finds-hedgehogs-in-decline-by-up-to-75/  pic.twitter.com/ApQxQ62hZH
