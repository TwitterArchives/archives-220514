This is correct and not a bad thing. JPOC are, like I have stated, never at fault. They were either oppressed into power, or used hard work ethic and therefore deserve it.

They then convinced everyone that racism was the ultimate evil, and the only way for conservative people to cope with this was to try and co-opt a word literally invented to attack them.
